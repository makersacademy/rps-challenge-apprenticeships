I started by creating a diagram of the expected request/response cycle (pic in files).
While I have managed to set up the server, with a homepage and initial registration of the name, as well as the following view of choices of RPS, I feel I have mimicked a lot of the steps I have done in the pairing challenge this week (Battle). What I have put together here is the same as what I had accomplished during the afternoon sessions in the other context. 

I'd like to revisit this program once I have had a chance to work through how to implement bigger pieces of code within my app.rb file. I have a rough idea but I don't feel like I have all the pieces at this point to execute it properly.
