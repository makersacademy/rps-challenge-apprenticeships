# Description of the challenge:

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( MAMA ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.
Your task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:
```
As a marketeer

# Further steps
- [ ] Code needs refactoring to eliminate repetition
- [ ] Need to design the webpage, implement bootstrap
- [ ] Host on heroku
- [ ] Fix issues arising from the random method
* Noticed that the randomiser sometimes returns nothing, have tried to fix it, so far have not figured out the issue, when playing you have to keep trying again until you get an actual response.
