# RPS Challenge

Simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Created using Sinatra.

To run: type into terminal -->     rackup -p 4567
 then open localhost:4567 in your browser

 To play: Simply enter your name as requested
 Choose your weapon- rock, paper or scissors.
 The computer will then make its choice and a winner will be declared.

 The game will continue until the user either presses the 'home' link or moves
 to another page in the browser.

 Difficulties faced: getting the session to keep the players' scores,
 getting a delay on the presentation of the computer's choice (could not get sleep
   to work, despite attempting to flush).

 With more time, I would refactor and look to take a more OOD approach to my coding.

 Lastly, had difficulty with some of my testing this week. This was due to not following
 a strictly TDD approach due to over excitement at the task at hand. 94% coverage but couple
 of tests not passing. Had to give up due to time running out.
