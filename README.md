I decided early on to concentrate on the logic of the program as opposed to any styling, so decided that I
would only do any CSS should I have time at the end, which unfortunately I did not.

If I had more time I would begin by using some basic styling and reorganise my program to be able to accommodate
two players (using class methods for my Player class would not suffice).

I would also extract some logic out of my Game class, as I feel there is too much responsobility for this class,
therefore not following the Single Responsibility Principle.
