The first thing that i will need to do is make a page to display a form for the user to enter their name with a submit button. Before i make this i will need to make a test (TDD) that fails. This will be a feature test.
A feature test was written for being able to enter the home page as well as to allow the user to enter their name. These are also now passing.

I then wrote a feature test to redirect the user to a 'play' page. This test is now passing.
I have also now written test to make a new instance of a new Player class which stores the name that they return, and shows it on the play page. This test is also now working.

Web_helpers file created to minimise the repetition in the code.

The user can now select a move and the saves that move and reports it back to the user.
This can move be used with logic to determine the winner/loser

There is now also a computer player that can select a random move which has been red-green'd.

Rock paper scissor logic established, but it seems to be very long hand. This logic has now been integrated into the app and works. There is now also an option of a rematch.

Lizard and spock integrated into logic and view.
Emojis and image added.

Image added to a separate help page

Slight refactoring completedS
