** MY MVC PLAN **
* CONTROLLER: HTTP GET REQUEST ——> VIEW (INDEX PAGE)
* VIEW (INDEX PAGE) : GIVES HTML FORM TO ENTER NAME  ——> CONTROLLER
* CONTROLLER: POSTS NAME INFORMATION (PLAYER.NEW(PARAMS[:NAME])) —-> MODEL: SAVED INFORMATION INTO MODEL.
* MODEL: PUSHES INFO BACK TO CONTROLLER -
* CONTROLLER - REQUESTS HTML FROM VIEW
* VIEW OF HOW THE NAME IS DISPLAYED WITH OPTIONS OF WEAPON —-> CONTROLLER
* CONTROLLER: WEAPON SELECTED —> MODEL (SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THE CLASS)
* MODEL - SENDS INFRO TO CONTROLLER
* CONTROLLER - VIEW REQUESTS INFO FROM HTML
* VIEW - GIVES BACK THE WINNER  also if they want to play again—> TO CONTROLLER
* CONTROLLER: POST BACK TO WEAPON OPTIONS IF THEY WANT TO PLAY AGAIN


** FIRST USER STORY **
* As a marketeer
* So that I can see my name in lights
* I would like to register my name before playing an online game
* First step according to MVC: CONTROLLER SENDS HTTP GET REQUEST TO VIEW
* I will create a new path way '/' & create a test to see if it works
