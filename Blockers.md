# Blockers

During this weekly challenge, I met many blockers. This topic was completely new for me. I think I understood the basics, how to use Sinatra, Capybara, write a basic html and use erb. But still not clear to me how can build up more complex tasks like a game.
My goals were this week:
    -Build a web app
    - Use html for user input
    - Use get and post methods
    - Use erb
    -Show user input on a different page
