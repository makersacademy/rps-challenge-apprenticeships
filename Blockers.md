# Blockers

During this weekly challenge, I met many blockers. This topic was completely new for me. I think I understood the basics, how to use Sinatra, Capybara, write a basic html and use erb. But still not clear to me how can build up more complex tasks like a game.
My goals were this week:
- Build a web app
- Use html for user input
- Use get and post methods
- Use erb
- Show user input on a different page
